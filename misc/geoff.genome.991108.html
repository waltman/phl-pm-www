The Human Genome Project is a decade old public/private effort and is now 
within about two years of completing the mapping of the 3 billion base pair 
sequence that is the Human Genome.  But those 3 billion pairs live in many 
small pieces, some of which are genes and actually do something.

Among the many things that may be learned are...

what the data looks like
what public resources are available
what types of things biologists like to do with the data
how Perl is used to make them happy
what some of their toys look like and a rough idea of how they work
how I can afford to put food on my puppy's floor.

All data shown will be from the public domain and properly scrubbed so you 
can't run to a competing pharmaceutical company to make a quick buck.
