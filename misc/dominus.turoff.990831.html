`Strong Typing' is a programming language feature that is
	supposed to help the programmer avoid errors and yield more
	correct code.  The language most people think of in connection
	with strong typing is Pascal.  But the type system in Pascal
	is not very successful---it doesn't catch very many errors,
	and it interferes with many common operations.</P>

	In the face of Pascal's failure, we can go in two directions.
	One of these directions is to give up and move towards Perl,
	which has no strong typing at all; this, as we know, has been
	a huge success.  But the other disrection is to try to make
	strong typing smarter, better, and more useful.  A functional
	programming language named ML is the present summit of this
	approach.</P>

	I'll spend a little time talking about the failures of Pascal,
	and then show how ML's type system succeeds where Pascal's
	fails.  Throughought, I'll compare with perl, and I'll end
	with a short explanation of the future direction of Perl's
	type facilities.</P>

This will be a "virtual meeting" with {St. Louis}.pm joining in.
